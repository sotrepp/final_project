# final_project
This is my Final Project in the class Drawing on the Web at NYU which features an interactive version of HC Andersen's The Nightingale. 


For my final project I will be creating an interactive version of the fairytale The Nightingale (“Nattergalen”), written by HC Andersen. I will be using mainly HTML + CSS elements along with JavaScript and CSS animation, but I may also include additional techniques such as SVG or an HTML canvas. 


### Summary of the Fairytale
The Nightingale is a story about a Chinese Emperor who learned that the most beautiful thing in his empire was the nightingale’s song. He invited the bird to appear at court and sing to him. After listening to the nightingale, the emperor ordered the bird to stay at court, deeply touched by the melodies. But one day a bejeweled, artificial bird was sent to the emperor and he lost interest in the real bird, who returned to the forest. 
However, it didn’t take long until the mechanical bird broke, and soon thereafter, the emperor fell deathly ill. After the real nightingale heard about this she returned and sang so beautifully that even Death was moved by the song, making him spare the emperor’s life.

### Project Outline
For my project, I decided to divide Andersen’s story into several parts: one for each page of my final project (I will shorten the story to prevent the experience from being too lengthy). By interacting with elements on the index page you guide the story forward. 
The index page will hold imagery of the entire kingdom; all the parts which will be featured in the story. While I’m not sure about its style yet, there will be some sort of directional arrows or numbers that help the user find the right part of the story (so that they don’t start at the end of the fairytale). 
While you visit the index page for the first time you will also hear the first lines of the story: the part where the kingdom is described, (this will not be repeated again though).

The next part of the story is reached if you click the first “stop” on the map over the empire – the forest, which is the place where the nightingale lives. After clicking the element, you will enter the forest, and a layered page with birch trees and a bird will appear. There will be slight animations such as swaying grass, and rustling trees. There will also be sound effects or animations which are triggered by the user hovering over an element: for example, of you hover over the bird it will sing, or if you hover over the trees, leaves will fall.
I might also add animations of people walking into the forest. 

The next page of my final project will take place in the palace, showing the fake bird sitting on a pillow in the throne room. The last page will be set in the emperor’s bedroom where he is lying, deathly ill. Just like the forest page, there will be slight animations and sound effects when you interact with both of these pages (a crowd, the fake bird for example). 

On each of the three pages there will be navigation links which allows you to return to the index page (the empire) if you so need, however, after the narrator has finished telling the story for one of the pages, you will be automatically redirected back to the empire. 


### Visual Style
Paper Puppetry: Objects should look like paper cut-outs. There will also be bright colors and interesting textures. I am additionally really interested in playing with 3D space, making it look like some objects are closer to the user than others. 

To further explain the visual style of my project I created a prototype of the first page of the story (the forest), though I haven’t yet recorded the narrating voice, meaning that there will be no story telling in this particular example. At this point there aren’t any interactive sound effects on the page either.
